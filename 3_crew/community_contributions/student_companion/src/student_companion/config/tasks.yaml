  description: >
    Analyze user input - {input} to identify the study topic and desired
    expertise level.  If the input expertise is unclear, try to keep it between
    Beginner and Intermediate.  If you are able to infer anything else from the
    input that would help in tailoring the study plan, include that as well.
